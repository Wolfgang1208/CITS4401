# Part2 Managing requirements

# Requirements: Analysis vs Validation

- **Analysis** works with raw requirements as elicited from the system stakeholders
  - "Have we got the right requirements" is the key question to be answered at this stage
- **Validation** works with a final draft of the requirements document i.e. with negotiated and agreed requirements
  - "Have we got the requirements right" is the key question to be answered at this stage

# Validation inputs

- Requirements document
  - Complete, formatted and organised according to organisational standards
- Organisational knowledge
  - Knowledge, often implicit, of the organisation; used to judge the realism
- Organisational standards
  - Local standards e.g. for the organisation of the requirements document

# Input: IEEE Standard

# Or input: PEGS books

# Validation outputs

- Problem list
  - List of discovered problems in the requirements document
- Agreed actions
  - List of agreed actions in response to requirements problems. Some problems may have several corrective actions; some problems may have no associated actions
- Management tools for this
  - Requirements document with version tracking
  - Issue tracking support

# Requirements reviews

- A group os people read and analyse the requirements, look for problems, meet and discuss the problems and agree on actions to address these problems

# Review checklists

- Understandability
  - Can readers of the document understand what the requirements mean?
- Redundancy
  - Is information unnecessarily repeated in the requirements document?
- Consistency
  - Do the descirptions of different requirements include contradictions? Are there contradictions between individual requirements and overall system requirements?
- Organisation
  - Is the document structured in a sensible way? Are the descriptions of requirements organised so that related requirements are grouped?
- Conformance to standards
  - Does the requirements document and individual requirements conform to defined standards? Are departures from the standards, justified?
- Traceability
  - Are requirements unambiguously identified, include links to related requirements and to the reasons why these requirements have been included?

# Checklist questions

- Is each requirement uniquely identified?
- Are specialised terms defined in the glossary
- Does a requirement stand on its own or do you have to examine other requirements to understand what it means?
- Do individual requirements use the terms consistently
- Is the same service requested in different requirements? Are there any contradictions in these requests?
- If a requirement makes reference to some other facilities, are these described elsewhere in the document?
- Are related requirements grouped together? If not, do they refer to each other?

# Ten Tests for requirements

1. Does each requirements have a fit criterion that can be used to test whether a solution meets the requirement?
2. Is every requirements in the specification relevant to this system?
3. Does the specification contain a definition of the meaning of essential tems within the specification?
4. Is every reference to a defined term consistent with its definition?
5. Is the context of the requirements study wide enough to cover everything we need to understand?
6. Does the requirement contain a rationale?
7. Have we asked the stakehodlers about conscious, unconscious and undreamed of requirements?
8. Does the specification contain solutions posturing as requirements?
9. Is the stakeholder value defined for each requirements?
10. Is each requirement uniquely idenrifiable?

# Class models

# Key Topics

1. UML Class diagrams (what they are for and how to read them)
2. Discovering objects (noun discovery method) and associations (Class, Responsibilities, Collaboration(CRC) method)

# Requirements Analysis Framework

- Requirements analysis generates an analysis model with 3 parts
  - Functional model: use cases & scenarios
  - Static analysis object model: class & object diagrams
  - Dynamic model: statechart & sequence diagrams (later in the unit)
- This week we will look at static class models
- Goal is to investigate the problem domain as far as possible before moving to the solution domain (for design & implementation)

# 1. UML Class diagrams

# Why build class models?

- Why do we build class models? In order to ...:
  1. Build, as quickly and cheaply as possible, a system that satisfies our current requirements
  2. Build a system which will be easy to maintain and adapt to future requirements

# What is a UML class diagram?
- A class diagram describes the types of objects in the system and the various kinds of static relationships that

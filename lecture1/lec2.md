# Requirement Engineering approach

- a system's users seldom know exactly what they want and cannot articulate all they know.
- even if we could state all requirements, there are many details that we can only discover once we are well into implementation
- even if we knew all the details, as humans we can master only complexity to an extent
- even if we could master all the complexity. external forces lead to changes in requirement, some of which may invalidate earlier

# Why is requirement engineering important

- poor requirements capture leads to SW developers solving the wrong problem or attemping an infeasible problem (this takes money)
- Misunderstanding the requirements leads to a chaotic development process (this takes money)

# Functional Requirement

- An area of functionality the system must support
- The functional requirements describe the interactions

# Non-functional Requirement

- A user-visible constraint on the system.

# Quality Attribute

# Project Requirements

- Business
  - describe in business terms what must be delivered or accomplished to provide value
- ## Product
- Process

# Review Questions

- Why do you think requirements change so much?

  - People may not have the main knowledges
  - They want the SW but they dont know the reality.
  - The idea is good and useful. But somehow against the local law.
    - so they want to change their requirements.
  - under estimated the value of the SW

- Requirements changes so much that it is difficult to predict in advance which software requirements **will persist and which will change**.
- This is equally difficult to predict how **customer priorities** will change as the project proceeds.
